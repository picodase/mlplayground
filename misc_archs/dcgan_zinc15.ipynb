        "Loss Functions and Optimizers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWith $D$ and $G$ setup, we can specify how they learn\nthrough the loss functions and optimizers.

We can specify what part of the BCE equation to\nuse with the $y$ input. This is accomplished in the training loop\nwhich is coming up soon, but it is important to understand how we can\nchoose which component we wish to calculate just by changing $y$\n(i.e. GT labels).\n\nNext, we define our real label as 1 and the fake label as 0. These\nlabels will be used when calculating the losses of $D$ and\n$G$, and this is also the convention used in the original GAN\npaper. Finally, we set up two separate optimizers, one for $D$ and\none for $G$. As specified in the DCGAN paper, both are Adam\noptimizers with learning rate 0.0002 and Beta1 = 0.5. For keeping track\nof the generator’s learning progression, we will generate a fixed batch\nof latent vectors that are drawn from a Gaussian distribution\n(i.e. fixed_noise) .

        "Training\n~~~~~~~~\n\nFinally, now that we have all of the parts of the GAN framework defined,\nwe can train it. Be mindful that training GANs is somewhat of an art\nform, as incorrect hyperparameter settings lead to mode collapse with\nlittle explanation of what went wrong. Here, we will closely follow\nAlgorithm 1 from Goodfellow’s paper, while abiding by some of the best\npractices shown in `ganhacks <https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks>`__.\nNamely, we will “construct different mini-batches for real and fake”\nimages, and also adjust G’s objective function to maximize\n$logD(G(z))$. Training is split up into two main parts. Part 1\nupdates the Discriminator and Part 2 updates the Generator.\n\n**Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**\n\nRecall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the\nprobability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In\nterms of Goodfellow, we wish to “update the discriminator by ascending\nits stochastic gradient”. Practically, we want to maximize\n$log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))$. Due to the separate mini-batch\nsuggestion from ganhacks, we will calculate this in two steps. First, we\nwill construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward\npass through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(D(x))$), then\ncalculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct\na batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this\nbatch through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(1-D(G(z)))$),\nand *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the\ngradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we\ncall a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.\n\n**Part 2 - Train the Generator**\n\nAs stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\nminimizing $log(1-D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes.\nAs mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient\ngradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we\ninstead wish to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish\nthis by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the\nDiscriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing\nG’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters\nwith an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real\nlabels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the\n$log(x)$ part of the BCELoss (rather than the $log(1-x)$\npart) which is exactly what we want.\n\nFinally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each\nepoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to\nvisually track the progress of G’s training. The training statistics\nreported are:\n\n-  **Loss_D** - discriminator loss calculated as the sum of losses for\n   the all real and all fake batches ($log(D(x)) + log(D(G(z)))$).\n-  **Loss_G** - generator loss calculated as $log(D(G(z)))$\n-  **D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the discriminator\n   for the all real batch. This should start close to 1 then\n   theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about why\n   this is.\n-  **D(G(z))** - average discriminator outputs for the all fake batch.\n   The first number is before D is updated and the second number is\n   after D is updated. These numbers should start near 0 and converge to\n   0.5 as G gets better. Think about why this is.\n\n**Note:** This step might take a while, depending on how many epochs you\nrun and if you removed some data from the dataset.\n\n\n"
